# 👋 Hey, I’m Syed Shaheer Hussain 🌙<img width="40" alt="Pakistan Flag" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bde3216-7a90-48be-810e-5dffdaf4dd7b" />
Hands-on learner | Professional problem-breaker | Practical Security & Cryptography Focus
Athelete | Art | Chess | Money | Pray | Peace 

Cyber Security student by degree, problem-solver by habit. A strong focus on hands-on security practices, encryption technologies, and vulnerability analysis.

## 🧠 Who am I?

I’m Syed Shaheer Hussain, currently doing my Bachelor’s in Cyber Security (BSCY).
I spend most of my time breaking problems, fixing them again, and pretending it was all part of the plan. A strong interest in vulnerability analysis, information assurance, and encryption technologies. My learning approach is lab-driven, focusing on practical implementation rather than purely theoretical understanding.

I code. 
I design.
I click.
I edit.
I overthink decisions.
And yes… I make them anyway. ⚽😄

## 🔐 What I’m Into

Cyber Security – because protecting systems is cooler than breaking them (legally 👀)

Coding – turning caffeine into logic since forever

Photography - I click pictures and edit them

Designing – making things look smart even before they are smart

Creative Thinking – when normal solutions are boring

Decision Making – especially football decisions (and yes, I still argue about them)

## 🤔 Why This GitHub Exists?

To build

To break

To learn

To fail

To fix

And repeat… professionally

Also:

Where else would I keep my late-night ideas?

Where else would my bugs feel at home?

And how else would future-me judge present-me?

## ♟️ Beyond Cyber Security

- Chess on Lichess.org/Chess Online & Offline/Chess.com (strategic thinking, pattern recognition)

## 😏 Fun Facts (Because Why Not?)

I’m funny (at least in my own head)

I mix logic with creativity

I believe good design = half the solution

I can over-engineer simple things… and simplify complex ones

I take football decisions very seriously (don’t test me)

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

Projects that worked

Projects that almost worked

Projects that taught me why they didn’t work

Code that improved over time (hopefully)

Ideas that started small and got out of control

## 🎓 Academic Interests

* Cyber Security & Vulnerability Assessment

* Information Assurance

* Encryption & Secure Data Handling

* Practical Security Labs and Simulations

I prefer hands-on labs over pure theory, as they provide deeper understanding and real technical confidence.

## 🔐 Practical Experience & Projects

I have worked on multiple security-focused projects, including:

- Secure Password Manager

- Secure File Encryption & Decryption Tool

- Caesar & Playfair Cipher Implementations

- Steganography: Hiding Data in Images

- Brute Force Attack Simulator on Hashes

These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of cryptography, secure storage, and attack methodologies.

## 🧠 Working Style

- Strong analytical and decision-making skills

- Creative approach to problem-solving

- Comfortable working independently or collaboratively

- Habit of late-night coding sessions (productivity peaks after hours)

## 🎯 Career Goals

I am actively interested in:

* Cyber Security Internships

* Freelance Security Projects

* Research Opportunities

* Long-term full-time roles in Cyber Security

My goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute meaningfully to secure systems and digital environments.

## ⚙️ How I Work

* Late-night coding sessions

* Coffee-powered debugging

* Music always on

* Mix of offensive and defensive security thinking

I enjoy both breaking systems to understand them and protecting them from chaos.

## 🎓 Core Areas of Interest

- Cyber Security Vulnerabilities

- Information Assurance

- Cryptography & Encryption Systems

- Secure Data Storage & Transmission

- Attack Simulation & Defensive Strategies

## ⚙️ Approach & Mindset

* Strong preference for hands-on labs

* Analytical and structured problem-solving

* Continuous learning through experimentation

* Comfortable working under minimal supervision

## ❓ Still Reading?

Good. That means one of these worked:

* The sarcasm

* The structure

* The curiosity

* Or the fact that you’re procrastinating too

So…
